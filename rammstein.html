    <h3>Rammstein</h3>
    <p>Rammstein (German pronunciation: [ˈʁamʃtaɪn], lit. "ramming stone") is a German Neue Deutsche Härte band formed in Berlin in 1994. 
        The band's lineup—consisting of lead vocalist Till Lindemann, lead guitarist Richard Kruspe, rhythm guitarist Paul Landers, bassist 
        Oliver Riedel, drummer Christoph Schneider, and keyboardist Christian "Flake" Lorenz—has remained unchanged throughout their history,
         along with their approach to songwriting, which consists of Lindemann writing and singing the lyrics over instrumental pieces the 
         rest of the band has completed beforehand. Prior to their formation, some members were associated with the punk rock acts Feeling B 
         and First Arsch. </p>
